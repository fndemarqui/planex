  $~~~~$The first example consists of a comparison between estimates obtained from the PH partial ML results from \texttt{survival::coxph}, which is the classic regression model, and the proposed BP based PH modeling discussed in previous sections, either using already available \texttt{stats:optim} or \texttt{HI:arms} \texttt{R} routines and \texttt{spsurv::spbp} interface to \texttt{Stan}. In the second example,  the assumption of proportional risks is violated thus a comparison between semiparametric PO model estimates were also done. The results obtained by maximizing the modified partial likelihood implemented in \texttt{timereg::prop.odds} were compared to the proposed BP modeling available at the \texttt{spsurv} package.
